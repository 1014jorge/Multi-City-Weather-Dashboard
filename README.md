# Multi-City-Weather-Dashboard
Created a multi city weather app that give you the current weather and a five-day forecast. It provides the current tempature wind speed and humidity. It also generates an icon for the current weather condition. The five-day forecast also provides icons based on the weather displayed. I used a gradient for the styling. Units used are set to imperial measurements.
